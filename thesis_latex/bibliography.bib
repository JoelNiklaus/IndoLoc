@article{indoor_positioning_method,
	Abstract = {Recently location based services (LBS) have become increasingly popular in indoor environments. Among these indoor positioning techniques providing LBS, a fusion approach combining WiFi-based and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques is drawing more and more attention of researchers. Although this fusion method performs well in some cases, it still has some limitations, such as heavy computation and inconvenience for real-time use. In this work, we study map information of a given indoor environment, analyze variations of WiFi received signal strength (RSS), define several kinds of indoor landmarks, and then utilize these landmarks to correct accumulated errors derived from PDR. This fusion scheme, called Landmark-aided PDR (LaP), is proved to be light-weight and suitable for real-time implementation by running an Android application designed for the experiment. We compared LaP with other PDR-based fusion approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a significant improvement with an average accuracy of 2.17 m.},

@article{continuous_indoor_positioning,
	Abstract = {To exploit the complementary strengths of WiFi positioning, pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), and landmarks, we propose a novel fusion approach based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF). For WiFi positioning, unlike previous fusion approaches setting measurement noise parameters empirically, we deploy a kernel density estimation-based model to adaptively measure the related measurement noise statistics. Furthermore, a trusted area of WiFi positioning defined by fusion results of previous step and WiFi signal outlier detection are exploited to reduce computational cost and improve WiFi positioning accuracy. For PDR, we integrate a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer to determine the user heading based on another EKF model. To reduce accumulation error of PDR and enable continuous indoor positioning, not only the positioning results but also the heading estimations are recalibrated by indoor landmarks. Experimental results in a realistic indoor environment show that the proposed fusion approach achieves substantial positioning accuracy improvement than individual positioning approaches including PDR and WiFi positioning.},

@mastersthesis{sensor_fusion,
	Abstract = {This project examines the level of accuracy that can be achieved in precision positioning by using built-in sensors in an Android smartphone. The project is focused in estimating the position of the phone inside a building where the GPS signal is bad or unavailable. The approach is sensor-fusion: by using data from the device's different sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope and wireless adapter, the position is determined. The results show that the technique is promising for future handheld indoor navigation systems that can be used in malls, museums, large office buildings, hospitals, etc.},

@article{machine_learning_indoor_localization,
	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the problem of localizing a mobile device based on readings from its embedded sensors utilizing machine learning methodologies. We consider a real- world environment, collect a large dataset of 3110 datapoints, and examine the performance of a substantial number of machine learning algorithms in localizing a mobile device. We have found algorithms that give a mean error as accurate as 0.76 meters, outperforming other indoor localization systems reported in the literature. We also propose a hybrid instance-based approach that results in a speed increase by a factor of ten with no loss of accuracy in a live deployment over standard instance-based methods, allowing for fast and accurate localization. Further, we determine how smaller datasets collected with less density affect accuracy of localization, important for use in real-world environments. Finally, we demonstrate that these approaches are appropriate for real-world deployment by evaluating their performance in an online, in-motion experiment.},
